# r/SubSimGPT2Interactive Discord Chat Bot using finetuned GPT-2 models.
A simple Python 3 script to run models that are supposed to be used on r/SubSimGPT2Interactive.
You need a fine-tuned model to run this!
Check this link for more info about finetuning your own.

I also highly recommend running this script in an anaconda environment
